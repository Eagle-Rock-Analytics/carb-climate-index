    "## California Climate Investment Projects Crosswalk\n",
    "This notebook analyses CCI funded programs and projects by connecting each CCI project with a primary associated climate risk, as defined by the California Climate Risk and Adaptation Index (Cal-CRAI). For the purposes of this project, the term 'climate risk' includes the following: \n",
    "* Extreme heat\n",
    "* Inland flooding\n",
    "* Sea level rise\n",
    "* Wildfire\n",
    "* Drought\n",
    "\n",
    "A sixth, non-climate risk categorization is provided for *greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation*, as many CCI projects are funded to broadly reduce GHG efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Steps:\n",
    "- CCI data is scanned for common keywords associated with the defined climate risks via a dictionary to automatically assign a climate risk based on any keyword found in the project description, program description, sector, category, or action.\n",
    "- When a project is assigned more than one risk:\n",
    "   - If it is a defined climate risk and greenhouse gas mitigation, the project is assigned to the climate risk.\n",
    "   - If it is more than one climate risk (excluding greenhouse gas mitigation), keywords are assessed in other data columns (SECTOR, CATEGORY, ACTION) to identify if there is a primary risk. If not, the project is manually assessed and assigned a primary risk classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the CCI data comprises 133,696 funded projects between 2015 and 2023. "

Treatments consist primarily of fuel reduction, fuel breaks, prescribed burns, and right of way clearance. Crews use manual and mechanical means to remove and rearrange surface and ladder fuels, thin stands, conduct prescribed burns, and execute combinations thereof, to lower the rates of fire spread, duration and intensity of fire, fuel ignitability, and ignition of tree crowns, and/or to create defensible spaces that enable more effective fire suppression efforts.   \n",
