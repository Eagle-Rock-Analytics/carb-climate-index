       "133466                                           Fuels Reduction Crews implement treatments on forest, woodland, shrubland, and grass landscapes to reduce fuel mass and fire-risk characteristics, and thereby, wildfire potential for California communities and ecosystems. Treatments consist primarily of fuel reduction, fuel breaks, prescribed burns, and right of way clearance. Crews use manual and mechanical means to remove and rearrange surface and ladder fuels, thin stands, conduct prescribed burns, and execute combinations thereof, to lower the rates of fire spread, duration and intensity of fire, fuel ignitability, and ignition of tree crowns, and/or to create defensible spaces that enable more effective fire suppression efforts. Crews' roles may include support to prepare sites for prescribed burns, targeted activities such as tree felling, limbing and bucking, and road maintenance such as erosion control, road assessment, and road grading, as well as responding to incidents. In addition to conducting these activities, Fuels Reduction Crews undergo training, perform project planning and administration, assist with surveys, participate in special projects, and contribute to facility and equipment maintenance and improvement. California's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund funds the Fuels Reduction Crews, including the establishment, enhancement, repair and provision of the facilities in which they operate and the supplying of associated operational needs.   \n",

Education and outreach will include proper tree planting and care, drought tolerant watering practices, GHG sequestration, and the benefits of clean air, water, and energy resources.
