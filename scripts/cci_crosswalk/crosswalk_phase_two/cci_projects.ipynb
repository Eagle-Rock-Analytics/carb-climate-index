Treatments consist primarily of fuel reduction, fuel breaks, prescribed burns, and right of way clearance. Crews use manual and mechanical means to remove and rearrange surface and ladder fuels, thin stands, conduct prescribed burns, and execute combinations thereof, to lower the rates of fire spread, duration and intensity of fire, fuel ignitability, and ignition of tree crowns, and/or to create defensible spaces that enable more effective fire suppression efforts.   \n",

Over 21,000 square feet of concrete is proposed to be removed with this project. The remaining 1,800 trees will be planted in residential or commercial districts that have existing open parkways (i.e., areas between the sidewalk and the curb) that can accommodate new trees.   \n",

Planting sites are focused primarily on private property and school-grounds. To receive a tree through the program, education will be mandated for each applicant. Education and outreach will include proper tree planting and care, drought tolerant watering practices, GHG sequestration, and the benefits of clean air, water, and energy resources. EC Foundation will train and create stipend based jobs for 50 certified Tree Stewards to engage the community and help support planting activities.

People set fires, whether with malice or not. High intensity fires release high amounts of PM2.5 and PM 10. Within the project area sits Pine Mountain Lake Association(PMLA), a large WUI subdivision with 2,834 buildable lots. If the project gets approved, this 641 acre fuel break will protect PMLA and the  communities of Groveland and Big Oak Flat from the east.
