       "107748  Clean Cars 4 All operates in conjunction with EFMP, the voluntary car scrap and replacement program implemented by CARB and local air districts in coordination with the Bureau of Automotive Repair.  CC4A provides additional incentives above the base EFMP incentive for lower-income consumers living in ZIP codes containing a disadvantaged community census tract who retire older vehicles and replace them with cleaner used or new hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or zero-emission vehicles.  Funded with auction proceeds in 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17.  2014‑15 and 2015-16 funding was limited to the San Joaquin Valley and South Coast air districts; 2021-2022 funding was available to any air district that implements a vehicle scrap and replacement program that meets the minimum requirements established in CARB's CC4A regulation and requests to participate.   \n",

Compost applications will enhance the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the soil that break down organic matter into humus. Improving soil biology and increasing organic matter levels in the soil lead to benefits of improved water holding capacity, reduced run-off, improved nutrient availability, and improved soil tilth. Soil samples will be taken before the project start, and annually through the project duration.

A non-leguminous cover crop of Blando Brome and Zorro Fescue will be seeded immediately with rubber tracked/low pressure tractor tires to reduce soil compaction. Soil samples will be taken annually to monitor soil health and changes due to management losses from harvesting. This project is expected to reduce annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 606.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.   \n",

       "89986         This project will consist of applying compost to 82 acres of Tree cropland in Merced. Project would consist of applying compost at 8 tons/acre for 3 years. The goals of the project are to positively effect crop yields and quality through soil building, with a primary goal being to increase the soil organic matter over 2 percent. Compost applications will enhance the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the soil that break down organic matter into humus. Improving soil biology and increasing organic matter levels in the soil lead to benefits of improved water holding capacity, reduced run-off, improved nutrient availability, and improved soil tilth. Soil samples will be taken before the project start, and annually through the project duration. Success will be measured looking at the soil organic matter levels, NPK on soil tests, as well as evaluating irrigation costs and amount of fertilizer needed.   \n",
