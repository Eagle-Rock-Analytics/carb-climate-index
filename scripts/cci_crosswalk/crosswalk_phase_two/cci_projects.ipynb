Treatments consist primarily of fuel reduction, fuel breaks, prescribed burns, and right of way clearance. Crews use manual and mechanical means to remove and rearrange surface and ladder fuels, thin stands, conduct prescribed burns, and execute combinations thereof, to lower the rates of fire spread, duration and intensity of fire, fuel ignitability, and ignition of tree crowns, and/or to create defensible spaces that enable more effective fire suppression efforts. Crews' roles may include support to prepare sites for prescribed burns, targeted activities such as tree felling, limbing and bucking, and road maintenance such as erosion control, road assessment, and road grading, as well as responding to incidents. In addition to conducting these activities, Fuels Reduction Crews undergo training, perform project planning and administration, assist with surveys, participate in special projects, and contribute to facility and equipment maintenance and improvement. California's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund funds the Fuels Reduction Crews, including the establishment, enhancement, repair and provision of the facilities in which they operate and the supplying of associated operational needs.</td>\n",

       "128241  Fuels Reduction Crews and Fuels Heavy Fire Equipment Operators implement treatments on forest, woodland, shrubland, and grass landscapes to reduce fuel mass and fire-risk characteristics, and thereby, wildfire potential for California communities and ecosystems. Treatments consist primarily of fuel reduction, fuel breaks, prescribed burns, and right of way clearance. Crews use manual and mechanical means to remove and rearrange surface and ladder fuels, thin stands, conduct prescribed burns, and execute combinations thereof, to lower the rates of fire spread, duration and intensity of fire, fuel ignitability, and ignition of tree crowns, and/or to create defensible spaces that enable more effective fire suppression efforts. Crews' roles may include support to prepare sites for prescribed burns, targeted activities such as tree felling, limbing and bucking, and road maintenance such as erosion control, road assessment, and road grading, as well as responding to incidents. In addition to conducting these activities, Fuels Reduction Crews undergo training, perform project planning and administration, assist with surveys, participate in special projects, and contribute to facility and equipment maintenance and improvement. California's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund funds the Fuels Reduction Crews, including the establishment, enhancement, repair and provision of the facilities in which they operate and the supplying of associated operational needs.   \n",

Mulch will be applied to our perennial crops in particular.  We have blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, asparagus, and artichokes that will greatly benefit from this practice. We hope to see a reduction in irrigation needs, increased soil tilth and structure, and the strong establishment of these crops for the future.  Compost will be applied topically to our vegetable fields and select perennial crops. We will be looking for reduced fertilizer needs, improved soil health, and better structure. Our goats are actively rotated throughout our property and adjacent parcels. We wish to improve our forest grazing areas with forage grasses that are drought tolerant and perennial. Observing new grass species in these forest conditions will be easily observable.   \n",
