    "## California Climate Investment Projects Crosswalk\n",
    "This notebook analyses CCI funded programs and projects by connecting each CCI project with a primary associated climate risk, as defined by the California Climate Risk and Adaptation Index (Cal-CRAI).  Risks include: extreme heat, inland flooding, sea level rise, wildfire, and drought. A sixth, non-climate risk categorization is provided for greenhouse gas mitigation, as many CCI projects are funded to broadly reduce GHG efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Steps:\n",
    "- CCI data is scanned for common keywords associated with the defined climate risks via a dictionary to automatically assign a climate risk based on any keyword found in the project description, program description, sector, category, or action.\n",
    "- When a project is assigned more than risk:\n",
    "   - If it is a climate risk and greenhouse gas mitigation, the project is assigned to the climate risk\n",
    "   - If it is more than one climate risk (excluding greenhouse gas mitigation), keywords are assessed in other data columns (SECTOR, CATEGORY, ACTION) to identify if there is a primary risk. If not, the project is manually assessed and assigned a primary risk classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the CCI data comprises 133,698 funded projects between 2021 and 2024. "

Crews' roles may include support to prepare sites for prescribed burns, targeted activities such as tree felling, limbing and bucking, and road maintenance such as erosion control, road assessment, and road grading, as well as responding to incidents. In addition to conducting these activities, Fuels Reduction Crews undergo training, perform project planning and administration, assist with surveys, participate in special projects, and contribute to facility and equipment maintenance and improvement.

Treatments consist primarily of fuel reduction, fuel breaks, prescribed burns, and right of way clearance. Crews use manual and mechanical means to remove and rearrange surface and ladder fuels, thin stands, conduct prescribed burns, and execute combinations thereof, to lower the rates of fire spread, duration and intensity of fire, fuel ignitability, and ignition of tree crowns, and/or to create defensible spaces that enable more effective fire suppression efforts. Crews' roles may include support to prepare sites for prescribed burns, targeted activities such as tree felling, limbing and bucking, and road maintenance such as erosion control, road assessment, and road grading, as well as responding to incidents.

Planting sites are focused primarily on private property and school-grounds. To receive a tree through the program, education will be mandated for each applicant. Education and outreach will include proper tree planting and care, drought tolerant watering practices, GHG sequestration, and the benefits of clean air, water, and energy resources. EC Foundation will train and create stipend based jobs for 50 certified Tree Stewards to engage the community and help support planting activities. This project compliments an Urban Forest Management grant in the same area.   \n",
