    "This notebook generates the text metadata files for the in-land flooding exposure metric `absolute change in 99th percentile 1-day accumulated precipitation`, using data from Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine data. Because the AE data represents 200+ GB of data, metrics were calculated with a cluster in a high performance computing environment (i.e., a pcluster). \n",
