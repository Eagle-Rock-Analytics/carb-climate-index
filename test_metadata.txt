Function name: communication_infrastructure_upload
Date function applied and/or metadata document generated: June 20, 2024
Function description: 
    Uploads prepared metric calculations within the communication infrastructure to the S3 bucket. The metrics are:
    - does a tract has low broadband speeds of <25 mpbs download
    - # of tv contour towers per county
    - # of microwave towers per county
    - # of radio towers per county
    - # of cellular towers per county
    - # of paging towers per county
    - # of mobile towers per county

    Data for this metric was sourced from Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data at:
    https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/ and the California Public Utilities Commission at https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/internet-and-phone/california-advanced-services-fund/project-development-resources---data-and-maps.

    Methods
    -------
    All data were reprojected to Cal-CRAI's standardized coordinate reference system (crs) 4269.
    Data was then spatially joined to California 2021 Tiger census tract data.
    Columns relevent per metric were maintained and summed to calculate total towers per county.
    For the broadband speed metric, a flag was used to indicate tracts with low internet speeds.
    Data was then merged back to 2021 census tract data so each CA tract has a metric value.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    input_csv: string
        csv communication metric data 
    export: True/False boolean
        False = will not upload resulting df containing CAL CRAI communication metric to AWS
        True = will upload resulting df containing CAL CRAI communication facility metric to AWS

    Note:
    This function assumes users have configured the AWS CLI such that their access key / secret key pair are stored in ~/.aws/credentials.
    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html for guidance.
    
Function output statements:
Data transformation: data cleaned by isolating and renaming relevant columns.
Data transformation: data was spatially joined to California census tract and county data.
Data transformation: an additional column was calculated by summing or flagging a specified column per county.
